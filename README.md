# Danmans Virtual Ticket App

This repository contains the source code for the Danmans Music Store Virtual Ticket and Rewards application.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this application is to provide an engaging and motivating system for music students at Danmans to track their progress and earn virtual tickets redeemable for rewards. This complements the physical ticket system, especially for students saving towards larger goals like musical instruments. The app aims to increase student motivation, retention, and potentially lesson attendance.

## Key Features

The application supports multiple user roles with distinct capabilities:

*   **Admin (Store Manager):** Full control over user management, rewards catalog, task library, and ticket adjustments/redemptions.
*   **Teacher (Danmans Employee):** Assigns tasks to students, verifies task completion, and awards tickets. Can view student progress.
*   **Pupil (Music Student):** Views assigned tasks, marks tasks as complete, tracks virtual ticket balance, and browses the rewards catalog.
*   **Parent (of Pupil):** Can link to one or more children's profiles, monitor their progress, mark tasks complete on their behalf, and view their ticket balance and history.

Core functionalities include:

*   Virtual ticket tracking and balance display.
*   Task assignment, completion, and verification workflow with flexible points awarding.
*   A browsable rewards catalog (also visible publicly).
*   Ticket transaction history.
*   Public announcements, including celebrations for major reward redemptions.
*   A streamlined in-store QR code based login process for non-Admin users.
