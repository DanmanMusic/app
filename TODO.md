# TODO: Project Development & Release

## Gemini Rules/Notes

- When requested to print out file content, provide the full content of the file while be mindful to inflate sections of code commented out during iterations.
- Absolute hard rule of no comments in any code. If code has comments please remove!
- Assume developers are experts but are open to suggestions for better libraries, approaches, or solutions to technical challenges.
- This project is in an early development phase. Backward compatibility is not a requirement (e.g., database schema changes are acceptable).

Remember to replace placeholders like `[ ]` with `[x]` as tasks are completed.

## [ ] Development Phase 2: Fixes, Remaining Features & API Refinements (Pre-Supabase)

### [ ] 1. Pending Decisions & Actions (Input: Dan Lefler)

*   [ ] **Provide Assets:** Supply storefront, interior, and lesson room photos (See SPECIFICATION.md Section 9).
    *   _(Example: Needed for the public welcome screen design)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Task Link URL:** Implement optional URL field for tasks?
    *   _(Example: Should teachers be able to add a link like `https://www.ultimateguitar.com/tabs/1234` to a "Learn Song X" task?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Image Needs:**
    *   Instruments (DB vs hardcoded)? _(Example: Show actual pictures of instruments available as rewards, or just generic icons like now?)._
    *   Avatars (which roles)? _(Example: Allow students and/or teachers to upload profile pictures?)._
    *   Mandatory Reward images? _(Example: Is it okay if some rewards, like a 'Snickers Bar', don't have a specific image uploaded?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Auto-Redemption Announcements:** Implement? Definition of significant? Message format?
    *   _(Example: When a student redeems the 'Fender Stratocaster' (cost 10000), should an announcement automatically appear saying "ðŸŽ‰ Alice redeemed a Fender Stratocaster! ðŸŽ‰"? Or only if Admin manually creates it?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Challenge Feature:** Go/No-Go for V1?
    *   _(Example: Should teachers be able to post 'challenges' like "Learn 3 new scales this month for 50 bonus tickets" that *any* relevant student can choose to accept and attempt?)._
    *   _If Go:_ Decide Targeting Rules (Teacher A challenges Teacher B's students?), Expiry (Challenges end?), UI differentiation (Challenge tasks look different?), Assignment Attribution (Who assigned it if student accepts?).
*   [ ] **Decide: Field Requirements:**
    *   Necessity of descriptions (Tasks, Rewards)? _(Example: Is just 'Practice 15 mins' enough, or do we need the extra description text field? Same for rewards?)._
    *   Finalize Announcement fields/types. _(Example: Is the 'message' field always needed? Are 'announcement', 'challenge', 'redemption' types enough?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Student Identifier for PIN Login:** Choose method. (PIN login *method* is set, but what do they type *with* the PIN?)
    *   _(Example: How does a student identify themselves with their PIN? By typing `Alice Wonder` + PIN, or `alice.w` + PIN, or `alice.wonder@email.com` + PIN?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Parent Login Identification Mechanism:** Specify differentiation logic. (Assumes parent uses child's ID/PIN).
    *   _(Example: If Mom Wonder logs in using `Alice Wonder` + Alice's PIN, how does the app confirm she's a Parent to show the Parent view? Does the backend check linked parents during login?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Additional Login Methods:** Offer Email/Password for Students/Parents too?
    *   _(Example: Should students *also* be able to set an email/password to log in, as an alternative to their Identifier+PIN? What about Parents having their own separate email/password login instead of using child credentials?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Parent Reminders Feature:** Go/No-Go for V1? (If Go, provide detailed specs).
    *   _(Example: Should parents have a button like "Nudge Alice about 'Practice Scales'" that shows a reminder in Alice's app?)._
*   [ ] **Decide: Data Deletion Policy:** Cascade delete or anonymize student tasks/history?
    *   _(Example: If Admin deletes student 'Bob', should all records of tasks Bob completed and tickets he earned disappear forever, or should they remain but just say 'Deleted Student' instead of 'Bob'?)._

### [ ] 2. Address Known Issues & TODOs
*   [ ] **Lint Errors:** Address remaining ESLint errors. Run `npm run lint -- --fix`.
*   [ ] **Dark Mode:** Implement Dark Mode support.
*   [ ] **Admin View (Created Users):** Test if new users appear correctly after creation (post TQ refactor).
*   [ ] **Role-Based Action Control:** Fully review/implement remaining permission checks.
*   [ ] **User Linking (Admin):** Add UI controls in Create/Edit User Modals for linking. (Connect to Supabase later).
*   [ ] **Balance in Modals:** Update `ManualTicketAdjustmentModal` and `RedeemRewardModal` to fetch/use actual current balance.

### [ ] 3. Implement Remaining Mock UI/Placeholders
*   [ ] **Student Action:** Implement Rewards redemption flow/button in `StudentView`.
*   [ ] **Parent Action:** Add mock "Link Another Student" button functionality/alert in `ParentView`.
*   [ ] **Teacher Action:** Add mock "View All Students" button functionality/alert in `TeacherStudentsSection`.

### [ ] 4. Refinements & Testing
*   [x] Test `instruments` CRUD operations against Supabase (Create, Read tested; Update Name, Delete DB/Storage tested).
*   [ ] Thoroughly test all user role workflows with remaining MSW mocks + Supabase instruments.
*   [ ] Refine UI/UX based on testing.
*   [ ] Add basic unit/integration tests (Optional for V1).

## [ ] Development Phase 3: Backend Development and Integration (Target: Supabase)

*   [x] Set up Supabase project.

*   [x] Install & Configure `supabase-js` client (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`).
    *   [x] Includes `.env` setup for keys.
    *   [x] Includes platform-specific storage adapter (`SecureStore`/`AsyncStorage`).
*   [ ] **Implement Authentication:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Implement secure PIN hashing/storage (`user_credentials` table).
    *   [ ] Backend: Create `login-with-pin` Edge Function.
    *   [ ] Backend: Create `set-student-pin` Edge Function.

    *   [x] Refactor `src/api/instruments.ts` (`fetchInstruments`) for Supabase.
    *   [ ] Refactor other `src/api/` functions & TQ `queryFn`s for Supabase (`fetchUsers`, `fetchTasks`, etc.).
    *   [ ] Update pagination hooks (`usePaginated*`) for Supabase (`range`, filters).
*   [ ] **Integrate Mutations:**
    *   [x] Refactor `src/api/instruments.ts` (`createInstrument`, `updateInstrument`, `deleteInstrument`) for Supabase DB operations.
    *   [ ] Refactor other mutation API functions for Supabase (`createUser`, `updateTask`, etc.).
    *   [ ] Develop Supabase Edge Functions for complex logic (Verification, Redemption, Adjustments, etc.).
*   [ ] **Implement Storage:**
    *   [x] Set up Supabase Storage Bucket for instruments (`instrument-icons`).
    *   [x] Refactor helpers/components to *display* images from Storage (`getInstrumentIconSource`, `AdminInstrumentItem`, `EditInstrumentModal`).
    *   [ ] Implement file upload logic for instruments (in Modals and API functions).
    *   [x] Implement file delete logic for instruments (integrated into `deleteInstrument`).
    *   [ ] Set up Buckets and implement Upload/Delete for Rewards/Avatars (if decided).
*   [ ] **Implement Features based on Decisions:** (Challenges, Task Links, Avatars, etc.)
*   [ ] **Remove MSW:** Uninstall dependency, remove handlers, setup files, `metro.config.js` shims (once all APIs are migrated).
*   [x] Define and Implement initial permissive RLS policies for `instruments`.
*   [ ] Define and Implement final, role-specific RLS policies for all tables.
*   [ ] Optional: Implement Realtime updates, Push Notifications.
