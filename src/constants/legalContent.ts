Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our service:
• Information You Provide: This includes names and nicknames for user profiles (Students, Teachers, Parents, Admins) that are created by an Administrator.

• Application Data: We collect and store data generated through your use of the App, such as task assignments, task completion dates, ticket transactions, practice streak logs, and reward goals.
• Push Notification Tokens: If you grant permission, we collect an anonymous push notification token from your device to send you relevant updates, such as task verifications and practice reminders.

How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of operating the App. This includes:
• To manage your account and provide you with access to the App's features.
• To track student progress, award tickets, and manage rewards.
• To send important notifications related to app activity.
• To display community-wide achievements, such as streak milestones, using only a student's name/nickname and avatar.
